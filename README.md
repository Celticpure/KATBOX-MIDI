# KATBOX-MIDI
BLE Midi Controller for Katana Librarian. 

This project is designed to work through the Katana Librarian android app, In the app the "Control Surface BLE" device is selected as the midi device. From there, hot keys can be selected to changed whatever options are avaible to the user for thier particular Boss Katana amp.

Using elements of the Control Surface library for BLE Midi and the multibuttonfunction for changing PATCH No., MOD, DELAY AND REVERB options on the Boss Katana Amp. 

The code is rough and no doubt can be condensed and streamlined to be more efficient as i have little or no coding experience, apart from what is have learned myself in the pass feww weeks. 


This is not exclusively for use with the Boss Katana or indeed Katana Librarian, It just happened to be the subject matter that drove me to compile this code. This could be applied to other devices like NuX Mighty Plug Pro etc.   


I am using ESP32 devkit v1 module with SH1106 display, Stomp switches are wired to GRD. Wiring diagram to follow.
